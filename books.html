                        <h2>How To Win Friends and Influence Friends</h2>

                        <h3>
                                Why should you care about winning friends and influencing people?
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                                Dealing with people is most likely one of the biggest challenges you face. Wether you are a architect, sales associate, engineer, or own a business, you will have to interact with people. Below, I mention some of the biggest ideas from the book I resonated with.
                        </p>

                        <h3>1. Become Genuinely Interested In Other People</h3>

                        <p class="quote">
                                <em>You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you. (pg 52)</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                We all have probably been in that situation where we meet a new person and that person goes on an on to talk about themselves. They keep on telling you what they do yet do not take the time to ask you what your hobbies are or what you do for a living. How does this make you feel? One key principle is that if you want someone to like you, you should make that person feel important.
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <h3>2. Let The Other Person Feel That The Idea Is His Or Hers</h3>

                        <p>
                                It's amazing what you can accomplish if you don't care who gets the credit for it. Allow other people to take credit for you. This reallys works in a team setting or a leadership role. We want credit for everything but if we step away from that and let other people take credit they will feel like their contribution is valuable. Definately a good way to get people to like you.
                        </p>

                        <h3>3. Talk About Your Own Mistakes Before Criticizing The Other Person</h3>

                        <p>
                                Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly. Share something vulnarable about yourself. By doing so the person you are communicating with will open up. They are more likely to not get defensive in the topic of conversation. If someone told you, "You should'nt being doing xyz" you will most likeley be defensive and respond back why you should be doing xyz. This can be altered by instead saying, "Hey, when I was your age I did something similar and I get it but it's not okay and here's why.". This causes the person being talked to be able to relate to the person who is speaking to them.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                                How do you give negative feedback without sounding like a jerk? or asshole?
                                TIP: Swap “BUT” for “AND”
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                "We're really proud of you Justin for getting better grades this semester BUT if you would've worked harded in your math class you would've done better"

                                <strong>VS</strong>

                                "We're really proud of you Justin for getting better grades this semester AND if you continue to work hard, your math grade can be as high as the others.
                        </p>

                        <h3>4. Dramatize Your Ideas</h3>

                        <h3>5. Talk in Terms of The Other Person’s Interests</h3>

                        <p class="quote">
                        <em>To influence people, talk about what they want and show them how to get it; don’t talk about what you want. (pg 31)</em>
                        </p>

                        <h3>6. Get The Other Person Saying “Yes, Yes” Immediately</h3>

                        <h3>7. Give Honest and Sincere Appreciation</h3>

                        <h3>8. Give the Other Person a Fine Reputation To Live Up To</h3>

                        <h3> 9. IDENTITY The Power of “I AM”</h3>

                        <h3>10. SAY MY NAME!</h3>
                        <p class="quote">
                                <em>People find their name the most interesting of all; remembering that name and calling it easy is an effective compliment. (pg 73)</em>
