                        <h2>How To Win Friends and Influence Friends</h2>

                        <h3>
                                Why should you care about winning friends and influencing people?
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                                Dealing with people is most likely one of the biggest challenges you face. Wether you are a architect, sales associate, engineer, or own a business, you will have to interact with people. Below I mention some of the biggest ideas from the book I resonated with.

                        <h3>1. Become Genuinely Interested In Other People</h3>

                        <p class="quote">
                                You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other peple than you can in two years by trying to get other people inerested in you.
                        </p>

                        <p class="quote">
                                <em>Win friends by being genuinely interested in other people, instead of trying to get other people interested in you. (pg 52)</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                We all have probable been in that situation in which we meet a new person and that person goes on an on to talk about themselves but never take the time to learn about you. They keep on about what they do yet do not take the time to ask you what your hobbies are or what you do for a living. How does this make you feel? If you want someone to like you, you should make that person feel important. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="quote">
                        To influence people, talk about what they want and show them how to get it; donâ€™t talk about what you want. (pg 31)
                        </p>

                        <p class="quote">
                                Fake a smile; act as though you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy. (pg 67)
                        </p>

                        <p class="quote">
                                People find their name the most interesting of all; remembering that name and calling it easy is an effective compliment. (pg 73)
                        </p>

                        <h3>2. Let The Other Person Feel That The Idea is His or Hers</h3>
